<p>Kimball Recital Hall, on the University’s City Campus at 11th & R Streets, serves as the home for UNL School of Music’s Concerts and Recitals by faculty, students and guest artists. Kimball Recital Hall is acoustically outstanding, and with only 850 seats, is one of the finest concert halls in the Midwest.</p><p>To provide the best possible physical setting for concerts and recitals, the building has an elliptical roof and a round ceiling with an irregular surface. The theatre-style chairs are arranged in a continental - long rows, not separated by dividing aisles - seating pattern on the main floor and in divided blocks on the balcony. There is also an orchestra pit capable of accommodating a 40-member ensemble.</p> <p>The recital hall is located adjacent to Westbrook Music Building, home of the UNL School of Music. Performances include the Faculty Recital Series, and  other faculty performances, including recitals and chamber music ensembles. Student performances include the UNL Orchestra, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, University Singers and Jazz Ensemble among others. The School of Music’s  Opera Program offers a repertoire of operas. Kimball Recital Hall also hosts several performances each year sponsored  by the Lied Center for Performing Arts including chamber music concerts and performances especially suited to  Kimball’s size.</p>
