<p>The Animal Sciences Complex consolidates all on-campus teaching, research, and extension programs for the Department of Animal Science into one facility. Modern classrooms, animal units for teaching management of livestock, and teaching and research laboratories with modern instruments and equipment have enhanced the capabilities of the department. The program emphasises breeding and genetics, meat science, nutrition, and physiology in each of the livestock and poultry species important to Nebraska.</p><p>Modern classrooms accommodate 20 to 200 students while the Library and Student Commons allow students to study independently or in small groups. Students develop their skills in least-cost ration formulation, study factors affecting response to genetic selection and learn applications for artificial intelligence programs in decision making.</p><p>Teaching and research laboratories offer diverse opportunities to study the many aspects of animal production. Teaching laboratories are used to deomonstrate the evaluation of feedstuffs, the manufacture of meat and poultry products, and the function of physiological systems. Metabolism stalls are used to determine digestibility of feedstuffs and to analyze which portions of food are used by animals for maintenance and for growth of lean, fat, and bone tissue.</p><p>Animal laboratories emphasize experimental learning as students are involved in the day-to-day management of livestock. These courses utilize such diverse resources as the swine farrowing-nursery facilities, a milking parlour, a battery brooder, quarters for ewes and lambs, stalls and pens for beef cows and calves, and cattle handling area to collect semen from bulls and artificial inseminate and pregnancy test cows. Modern horse stalls and a full-size riding arena are also part of the facilities.</p>
