<p>Behlen Laboratory of Physics is a three-story structure (with two basements) that adjoins Brace Laboratory on the east side of the city campus at University of Nebraska Lincoln.</p><p>One of the highlights of the building is a concrete-lined room in the sub-basement (originally developed for nuclear accelerator research) which houses the ultra-high-intensity laser system Diocles, which was built at UNL to study the interactions of light with matter at the highest attainable field strengths with the highest combination of peak power and repetition rate of any laser in the U.S.</p><p>Behlen Laboratory also houses an instrument shop capable of providing precision work for the needs of research equipment, as well as a variety of laboratories, libraries, conference rooms, and departmental offices.</p>
