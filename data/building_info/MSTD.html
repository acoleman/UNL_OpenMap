<p>The Tom and Nancy Osborne Athletic Complex is the new home of Nebraska Football at the north end of Memorial Stadium. In addition to housing the Huskers' football locker room, Strength Complex and Athletic Medicine areas, the building houses the football coaches offices and Nebraska's athletic administrative areas.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Osborne Athletic Complex features an inspirational call to action from famed Nebraska orator William Jennings Bryan.</p>
<p><em>"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice."</em></p>
<p>A plaque explaining the atmosphere around William Jennings Bryan's famous speech has been placed near the entrance to the Osborne Athletic Complex. Chris W. Eskridge, Ph.D., a professor of criminal justice at Nebraska, researched and selected the quote for use above the building's entrance.</p>
<p>Once inside the main doors on the Northwest corner of the Osborne Athletic Complex, visitors will be greeted by a stunning 40-foot waterfall, an impressive and sophisticated donor wall and the entrance to the Charles and Romona Myers Performance Center.</p>
