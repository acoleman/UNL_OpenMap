<p>The Beadle Center joins together four units - biochemistry, biological sciences, chemical engineering and the UNL Center for Biotechnology. In the center, researchers on the cutting edge of research in biochemistry and biological sciences forge interdisciplinary projects. They work closely with their colleagues in the center, with faculty in other departments on campus, and with researchers in other institutions both in the United States and abroad.</p><p>The Center for Biotechnology puts several highly sophisticated and expensive core facilities in a single location to serve the research interests of all faculty members. With faculty members from the Department of Chemical Engineering added to the mix, the Beadle Center provides a fertile setting for the development of tools and techniques for applying the fruits of basic research undertaken in the Beadle Center.</p>
