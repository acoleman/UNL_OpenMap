<p>Both physics and astronomy have been taught at UNL since the University first opened its doors to students in 1871. In the earliest years, classes consisted merely of recitations by students of material memorized from their textbooks; there were no lectures, discussions, or laboratories.</p><p>As the University grew, there began to be more specialization and under the enlightened leadership of some of the early chancellors several excellent scholars were added to the faculty. One of these was DeWitt Bristol Brace who came to Nebraska in 1887. His contributions to UNL and to the field of physics were numerous, and it is in his honor that Brace Hall, completed in December of 1905, was named.</p><p>For further information consult the book <em>Science on the Great Plains: The History of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</em> by M.
