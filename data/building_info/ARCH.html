<p>Built in 1894 as a library, Architecture Hall is the oldest building on campus. The symbolic and sentimental home of architecture at UNL, Architecture Hall stands as a monument not only to an historic style of architecture, but also to the progress of a University and the thousands of students who ascended the famous wooden staircase into its design studios.</p> <p>Today, the College of Architecture is a busy and exciting place. The College's programs in architecture, interior design and community planning have a proud tradition of excellence in education, research, and service to the State of Nebraska and the nation.</p> <p>Some 700 students are enrolled in Architecture classes, learning with a faculty of 37 to explore the past, present, and future of our communities. From gallery displays and provocative seminars, to the quiet of the Architecture Library, the bustle of the design studio, and the excitement of a community town hall meeting, the College of Architecture is at work.</p>
