<p>The insectary was built in 1953 and since that time has housed the entomology research laboratory offered students a controlled environment to study insects , their effects on plant life, and pesticides.</p><p>The lab consists of three main parts: a 0 by 26-foot main floor and laboratory and a basement (which includes a cold storage room), an 88 by 25 greenhouse, and a laboratory where toxicological studies on insects can be made. The main floor also houses a bee keeping laboratory.</p><p>The greenhouse is divided into six compartments, which facilitates the control of temperatures in each. The screenhouse is used in the summer for caging insects under investigation, while a machine shop allows for construction of insect cages and other repairs.</p>
