<p>Miller Hall on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln East Campus wasn't always known by that name. Built in 1908 as the College of Agriculture's Livestock Judging Pavilion, it was rebuilt after a 1931 fire. The red brick building became Miller hall in 1972 when it was named for Mr. and Mrs. Leon Miller, whose Red Willow county farm was described as "one of the best in the country, a tribute to the value of agriculture research and knowledge and to the superior managerial ability of the two pioneers."</p>

On the second floor, the professional staff in CIT (Communications and & Information Technology) Computing provide computer and networking guidance and support to IANR and extension personnel throughout the state and to students who use the computer labs and classrooms on East Campus and at the Panhandle Research and Extension Center.</p>
