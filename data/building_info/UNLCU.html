<p>In 1937, seven faculty members founded the University of Nebraska Federal Credit Union. The founders sent out letters to faculty members encouraging participation. NUFCU attracted Depression-weary professors and those who were rejected by banks. Joining a credit union seemed a better alternative to loan sharks. Membership was initially only open to faculty members. NUFCU only offered savings accounts at first but then distributed its first loan in February 1939.</p>
<p>NUFCU was operated out of a faculty memberâ€™s desk drawer for the first five years, moved to the Dairy Building on East Campus in 1943, to Agricultural Hall six years later, to the Faculty Club on City Campus in 1969, to the 501 building prior to construction of the Wick Alumni Center and then to 1630 Q Street in 1985. In 1997, NUFCU started another branch at 301 N 52nd Street.</p>
<p>Today, NUFCU has nearly 10,000 members and over $62 million in assets. It offers checking and savings accounts, credit cards, consumer loans, mortgage loans, business loans, telephone teller, online bill pay and many other services. Individuals eligible for membership include University of Nebraska faculty, staff, volunteers, students and their families.</p>
