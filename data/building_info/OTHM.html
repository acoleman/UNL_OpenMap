<p>Donald F. Othmer Hall is the home of the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Office of College Relations and the Dean's office suite. Othmer Hall is located on the south side of Walter Scott Engineering Center at 17th and Vine streets.</p><p>The four-story brick and limestone building features the latest in research laboratory design, including a bio-process manufacturing facility, the first of its kind in any American university; a state-of-the-art computer control system for laboratories; and next-generation distance education technology.</p><p>Funding for the $24 million building came from the estate of Mildred Topp Othmer, who died in 1998. Mildred, a 1928 graduate of UNL, was the widow of Donald F. Othmer, a noted chemical engineer and professor at Polytechnic Institute of New York in Brooklyn. Donald graduated from the University of Nebraska with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1924 and earned a master's degree and doctorate from the University of Michigan. Throughout his long career he accumulated 150 patents in a variety of fields. In 1947, he and Raymond Kirk, a Polytechnic colleague, published the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. The 27-volume collection is a mainstay in virtually every university, research facility and company that uses chemical processes.</p>
