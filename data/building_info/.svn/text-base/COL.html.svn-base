<p>Proposed by John Selleck, business manager for the Athletic Department, the Coliseum was financed by the Nebraska Athletic Alumni Association. George Holmes again arranged for financing through his office as president of the First National Bank. Davis and Wilson, having successfully designed and constructed the Stadium, were hired to design the Coliseum. It was completed in time for Commencement exercises to be held there in the spring of 1926.</p><p>The Coliseum was intended to provide space for sporting and social events. Univeristy officials decided to incorporate a stage into the design, making the Coliseum a versatile building which could be used for an assortment of activities. While the original building was constructed with funds provided by the NAAA, the stage addition was financed by the University.</p><p>Stylistically the Coliseum blends well with the other buildings on Memorial Mall, particularly Morrill Hall and Memorial Stadium. Also designed by Ellery Davis, these structures present a collegial dignity well suited to a large University. The tall doric columns of the Coliseum lend an imposing and elegant presence to the Mall.</p>
