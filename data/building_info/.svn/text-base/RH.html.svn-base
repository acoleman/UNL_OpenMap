<p>The Department of Art &amp; Art History is housed in two buildings, Nelle Cochrane Woods Hall and Richards Hall. Both are in the "arts quadrangle," which is the southwest corner of city campus, generally the area of the original 4-block University of Nebraska campus.</p> <p>Richards Hall houses the department's gallery of art (the Eisentrager-Howard Gallery); painting, drawing, visual literacy, sculpture and ceramics classrooms; a 1500 square-foot papermaking studio; and faculty and student studios. A multimedia-equipped 200-seat auditorium and a 46-seat seminar room are located on the lower level.</p><p>The Eisentrager-Howard Gallery of the Department of Art &amp; Art History on the first floor is an integral part of the educational process at UNL, providing the department, general public and University community with opportunities to view, contemplate and interact with contemporary artwork from a variety of sources both at the national and international levels.</p>

<p>The department's gallery serves as an extension of the studio and classroom learning experience. The opportunity for students and the public to meet and discuss contemporary art issues with an artist who may be exhibiting in the gallery is an important aspect of the gallery programs. Regularly scheduled exhibitions include traditional thematic shows that complement the curriculum, as well as installations and site-specific works that introduce students to new genres. The gallery maintains a commitment to exhibiting artists who reside in the state of Nebraska focusing on those in Lincoln and Omaha.</p>
