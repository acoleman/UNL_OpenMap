<p>The home of the Huskers since 1923 and the location of a continuing NCAA-record sellout streak that reached 282 games at the conclusion of 2006, Memorial Stadium has undergone some dramatic changes recently.</p>
<p>More than 6,500 seats were added in the North Stadium as part of the Memorial Stadium Expansion Project, which brought the historic stadium's capacity to 81,067 in 2006.  The impressive changes, include one of the largest in-stadium replay screens in the nation.</p>
<p>Inscribed on the four corners of the stadium are the following words, written by former UNL professor of philosophy Hartley Burr Alexander:</p>
<p><strong>Southeast:</strong> "In Commemoration of the men of Nebraska who served and fell in the Nations Wars."</p>
<p><strong>Southwest:</strong> "Not the victory but the action; Not the goal but the game; In the deed the glory."</p>
<p><strong>Northwest:</strong> "Courage; Generosity; Fairness; Honor; In these are the true awards of manly sport."</p>
<p><strong>Northeast:</strong> "Their Lives they held their countrys trust; They kept its faith; They died its heroes."</p>
