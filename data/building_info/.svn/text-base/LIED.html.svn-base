<p>Completed in 1989, the Lied Center for Performing Arts is a state-of-the-art performing arts facility. The Lied serves students and residents of the entire region by bringing the world's finest arts and entertainment to its stage. It offers major regional, national and international events. It also provides opportunities for Nebraska artists to perform and a teaching/training laboratory for performing arts departments at UNL.</p><p>The entire building covers 150,000 square-feet, with seating for 2,278. The auditorium is an instrument itself. There are no parallel walls and the seats were specially designed to absorb the same amount of sound whether people are sitting in them or not. This means the acoustics in the hall are perfect. A performance will sound as good with an audience of 200 or a full house. The front of the main stage is only 150 ft. from the very back of the balcony, creating a feeling of intimacy.</p><p>Lied includes a black box theatre, named The Johnny Carson Theater, that incorporates adjustable acoustics. This means that the acoustics of the main hall can be duplicated in this room. The Johnny Carson Theater has movable seating and can be used as a small theater for public performances as well as for dance and music rehearsals. Lied also houses a conference room, teaching spaces, and other facilities.</p>
