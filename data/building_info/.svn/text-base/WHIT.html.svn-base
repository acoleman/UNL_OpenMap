<p>The former Whittier Junior High School is now the newly renovated Whittier Research Center. This research facility has ground source heating and cooling, makes use of LED lighting in corridors and stairways, and has an energy consumption monitor near the front entrance so visitors can see just how much or little they are consuming. Whittier is home to the Nebraska Center for Energy Sciences Research, the Nebraska Transportation Center, the National Bridge Research Organization, Midwest Roadside Safety Facility, and future home for the Global Institute for Water and Food.</p>
