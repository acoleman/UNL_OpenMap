<p>The influences of parks such as the Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, Victory Field in Indianapolis and Franklin Covey Field in Salt Lake City, are evident throughout Hawks Field at Haymarket Park. The exterior is of red-brick, while the spacious concourse level is highlighted by exposed ironwork. The playing surface is nestled in a bowl, allowing berm seating along both lines and throughout the outfield and a raised batter’s eye consisting of pine trees in center field.</p><p>The features make Haymarket Park a first-class facility. The ballpark’s setting also allowed the designers to use Memorial Stadium and downtown Lincoln to provide a picturesque backdrop in the outfield. In May of 2002, the pedestrian connector was completed, allowing fans to make the walk from downtown Lincoln to the center field entrance of Haymarket Park.</p><p>Although many of the park’s amenities – the 4,419 chairback seats, 16 suites, a towering video board/scoreboard in right center field, the Buck Beltzer Playground for kids down the right field line and numerous restrooms and concession stands – are apparent to fans, the most unique feature is the one-of-a-kind SubAir system. The technology can both heat and cool the field, allowing grass to be grown nearly year-round. Hawks Field was one of the first facilities - and the first collegiate venue - in the country that used the state-of-the art SubAir system.</p><p>Hawks Field at Haymarket Park was selected as the best playing surface in each of its five years of existence. In November of 2003, Hawks Field received another honor, as it won the Baseball Field of the Year Award in the College/University division by the Sports Turf Managers Association (STMA).  The ballpark is more than a playing field for the Huskers. It includes medical and laundry facilities, coaches’ offices and a 1,400 square foot locker room and adjacent clubhouse, giving the Husker program one of the best baseball setups in the country.</p>
