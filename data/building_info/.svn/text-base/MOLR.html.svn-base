<p>April of 2008 marked the opening of the Ken Morrison Life Sciences Research Center on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln (UNL). The $21 million, 74,000-square-foot research facility with labs, faculty, student, and administration  offices, houses most of the UNL virologists who are affiliated with the Nebraska Center for Virology, one of the university's signature research programs. These faculty worked at several locations across campus before moving into the new building.</p><p>The building features state-of-the art equipment and research space for 14 faculty and was designed to enable the Virology Center to expand research on many of the leading viruses.  UNL virologists study the molecular mechanisms that viruses use to cause disease in humans, plants, and animals. Their discoveries have the potential to lead to new tools to prevent or treat diseases caused by HIV, human papilloma virus, herpes and other major viruses.</p><p>The Morrison Center was designed to foster interactions and collaborations among researchers, students, and staff and includes a large seminar room with video conferencing capabilities, multiple conference rooms, and spaces designed to foster and encourage faculty and student researchers from different labs to interact and share ideas over lunch or coffee. The Ken Morrison Life Sciences Research Center is named in honor of Mr. Ken Morrison, a Hastings, NE, businessman, University of Nebraska Foundation trustee, and long-time UNL supporter, who provided the lead private gift for construction.</p>
