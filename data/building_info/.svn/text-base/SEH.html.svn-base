<p>A part of the Selleck Quadrangle, Seaton Hall opened in the fall of 1954. Seaton is named after Lawrence F. Seaton (1887-1948) [who] was the university's operating superintendent and purchasing agent. Seaton, an NU graduate, gave 35 years of service to the university. Under his direction, many prominent campus buildings--including the Coliseum, Field House, Nebraska Union, Andrews Hall, Morrill Hall, Love Library and a number of residence halls--were constructed.</p><p>Seaton Hall was first a dormitory during the post war years at UNL when the influx of returning soldiers caused a housing shortage. In the early 1970s Seaton was converted from a residence hall into a number of offices and housed faculty from such departments as educational psychology, actuarial science, and housing.</p><p>In Oct. 2000 Graduate Studies became the sole occupant, with a redesigned entryway which included a handicap accessible door and elevator. The Plains Humanities Alliance and the Cather Project joined graduate studies in 2001. In 2003, with the creation of the Office of Undergraduate Studies, plans were under way to renovate the second and third floors to create usable office space and conference rooms.</p><p>Renovation began in the summer of 2004 to convert the old offices/dorm rooms and offices began taking up residence in the spring of 2005.</p>
