"1","ARCH","<p>Built in 1894 as a library, Architecture Hall is the oldest building on campus. The symbolic and sentimental home of architecture at UNL, Architecture Hall stands as a monument not only to an historic style of architecture, but also to the progress of a University and the thousands of students who ascended the famous wooden staircase into its design studios.</p> <p>Today, the College of Architecture is a busy and exciting place. The College's programs in architecture, interior design and community planning have a proud tradition of excellence in education, research, and service to the State of Nebraska and the nation.</p> <p>Some 700 students are enrolled in Architecture classes, learning with a faculty of 37 to explore the past, present, and future of our communities. From gallery displays and provocative seminars, to the quiet of the Architecture Library, the bustle of the design studio, and the excitement of a community town hall meeting, the College of Architecture is at work.</p>"
"2","BL","<p>Both physics and astronomy have been taught at UNL since the University first opened its doors to students in 1871. In the earliest years, classes consisted merely of recitations by students of material memorized from their textbooks; there were no lectures, discussions, or laboratories.</p><p>As the University grew, there began to be more specialization and under the enlightened leadership of some of the early chancellors several excellent scholars were added to the faculty. One of these was DeWitt Bristol Brace who came to Nebraska in 1887. His contributions to UNL and to the field of physics were numerous, and it is in his honor that Brace Hall, completed in December of 1905, was named.</p><p>For further information consult the book <em>Science on the Great Plains: The History of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</em> by M.
